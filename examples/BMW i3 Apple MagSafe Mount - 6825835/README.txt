BMW i3 Apple MagSafe Mount by JLiz on Thingiverse: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6825835

Summary:
Mount for an Apple MagSafe charger that is designed to securely fit into the BMW i3 cup holder slots. File to 3D print the mount is available and that worked well, but in spirit of the i3's construction we made a mold and made one out of forged carbon fiber. The carbon fiber process wasn't for the faint of heart, but we think it turned out really well!If going the mold route, use 6x 9mm M6 and matching nuts to hold the two bottom pieces together. I coated all of the mold pieces very liberally with mold release spray (I usedMann Release Technologies Ease Release 200).I roughly followed the process described in Easy Composite's guide (you can skip past the part about creating the mold).https://www.easycomposites.co.uk/learning/compression-moulding-forged-carbon-fibreWhen filling the mold, I started with the bottom half, then added in the two 4 pieces that create the gap in the middle of the part, then filled the rest above before finally adding the "top" part of the mold and clamping down with two c clamps.
